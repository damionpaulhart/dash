# dash
Currently a test project starting with bootstrap dashboard example.
Purpose is to create an easy 'go-to' for starting a dashboard interface on systems that do not have them
[for instance if company is just keeping log files, but wants to 'see' the logs as charts/graphs]

using:
boostrap
node
webpack
will add in other js libraries to test their functionality:
for example: comparing Chart.js to Google.Charts.
