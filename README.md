# dash
Currently a test project
 
 starting with bootstrap dashboard example.
 
Purpose is to create an easy template for starting a dashboard interface on
 systems that do not have visualization.
 
For instance if you have log files, but want to 'see' the logs as charts/graphs

Will also allow export and useful sorting/filtering

Using:

* boostrap
* node
* webpack
* Chart.js

Will add in other js libraries to test their functionality:
For example: comparing Chart.js to Google.Charts.
